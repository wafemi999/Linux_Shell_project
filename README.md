# Linux_Shell_project

#Scenario
You are a lead linux developer at the top-tech company “ABC International INC.” ABC currently suffers from a huge bottleneck - each day, interns must
painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers, and backup those that were updated within the last 24-hours. This introduces human error, lowers
security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work.
As ABC INC’s most trusted linux developer, you have been tasked with creating a script backup.sh which automatically backs up any of these files that have been
updated within the past 24 hours.
